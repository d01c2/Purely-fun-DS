# Purely-fun-DS

> Too many data-structure implementations are written in imperative programming language!

> Implementation in point of view of Functional Programming is *Terra Incognita*... 

**Purely-fun-DS** is a repository for implementing purely fuctional data structures in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). The concepts are inspired by the book ["Purely Functional Data Structures"](https://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Data-Structures-Okasaki/dp/0521663504). The codes and concepts in this book are written in Standard ML, but in this repository, we'll re-implement in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). Also, it won't be exactly same as the book because we added some behaviors according to ["쉽게 배우는 자료구조 with 파이썬"](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001743850).
