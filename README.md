# Purely-fun-DS

> Too many data-structure implementations are written in imperative programming language!

> Implementation in point of view of Functional Programming is *Terra Incognita*... 

**Purely-fun-DS** is a repository for implementing purely fuctional data structures in [OCaml](https://www.ocaml.org/). The concepts are inspired by the book ["Purely Functional Data Structures"](https://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Data-Structures-Okasaki/dp/0521663504). The codes and concepts in this book are written in Standard ML but, in this repository, we'll re-implement in [OCaml](https://www.ocaml.org/).
